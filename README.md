NEWS
====
* Upcoming CK presentation at [ARM TechCon'16 (Oct. 27)](http://schedule.armtechcon.com/session/know-your-workloads-design-more-efficient-systems);
* ARM uses CK as a front-end for systematic and reproducible benchmarking and tuning of real workloads: [link](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-wa); 
* Open challenges in computer engineering have been updated: [link](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Research-and-development-challenges);
* General Motors and dividiti shared CK workflow to crowdsource benchmarking and optimization of CAFFE (DNN framework) [here](https://github.com/dividiti/ck-caffe);
* We have moved related Open Science resources [here](http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Enabling-Open-Science);

Introduction
============

This [CK-powered](http://github.com/ctuning/ck) open-source Android application 
lets the community participate in experiment crowdsourcing using their 
mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets, IoT, etc)
and exchange knowledge via public CK servers.

You can download this app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=openscience.crowdsource.experiments). 

You can also find public results at [Live CK repo](http://cknowledge.org/repo)!

Current scenarios include multi-dimensional and multi-objective
optimization of benchmarks and real workloads such as 
GCC and LLVM multi-objective crowd-tuning (performance / code size / bugs).

More information is available [here](http://cKnowledge.org/repo).

If you found this app useful for your R&D, you are welcome
to reference any of the above publications in your articles
and reports. You can download all above references in one 
BibTex file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctuning/ck-guide-images/master/collective-knowledge-refs.bib).

Testimonials and awards
=======================
* 2014: HiPEAC technology transfer award: [HiPEAC TT winners](https://www.hipeac.net/research/technology-transfer-awards/2014)
* 2015: ARM and the cTuning foundation use CK to accelerate computer engineering: [HiPEAC Info'45 page 17](https://www.hipeac.net/assets/public/publications/newsletter/hipeacinfo45.pdf), [ARM TechCon'16 presentation and demo](http://schedule.armtechcon.com/session/know-your-workloads-design-more-efficient-systems), [public CK repo](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-wa)

Notes
=====

* API 29 prevents exec() to run downloaded codeletes - we need to find a new solution.

Acknowledgments
===============

CK development is coordinated by the [cTuning foundation](https://cTuning.org) (non-profit research organization).
We are also extremely grateful to all
volunteers for their valuable feedback and contributions.
